# ME-rPPG
The official code of ME-rPPG. We implemented memory-efficient real-time step-by-step inference using ME-rPPG.

## Inference Example 

Performing step-by-step inference through the following code. 

```python
state = load_state('state.json')
model = load_model('model.onnx')

while True:
  ........
  facial_img = crop_face(frame) # Cropping to a 36Ã—36x3 RGB facial image
  output, state = model(facial_img, state) # Computing the BVP and updating the state
  ........
```

## Web Browser Inference Demo
The following is our implemented web browser inference demo, which operates directly within the browser without requiring video uploads or GPU acceleration.

## Training Framework 
The ME-rPPG was trained on RLAP using PhysBench, with the full code coming soon.
